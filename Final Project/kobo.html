		<h3>Kobo Kanaeru</h3>
		<h3>こぼ・かなえる</h3>

		<p>"A carefree girl who lives in the topmost room of a lighthouse, she is actually the bloodline of the strongest rain shaman in the area. She has great potential to control rain, but she does not like to do it as a task.
In order to win back her Rain Master title, she needs to prove to her family that she can keep their rain shaman service afloat. Not only does she have to train daily, but she also needs to adopt some sort of virtual marketing strategy to succeed!"</p>
		<h3>Background Information</h3>
		<p>Kobo Kanaeru (こぼ・かなえる) is a female Indonesian Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, debuting as part of its Indonesian (ID) branch third generation of VTubers alongside Vestia Zeta and Kaela Kovalskia.</p>
		<p>Because of her short stature and immature mannerisms, Kobo initially projects the image of an endearing, energetic child with strange tendencies. However, she more often acts like a sassy, spoiled brat who frequently demands praise and playfully insults her peers or banters with them. She can very quickly lose her temper when enraged or provoked (notably by Regis Altare), and also gets flustered easily. </p>
		<p>She is often considered one of the most "childlike" members of hololive that inspires others to pamper her like their little sister or daughter, although she is not above taking advantage of this to gain (often material) benefits. In spite of her childish "gremlin-like" attitude, not only is she tremendously talented and clever, but also capable of genuine sweetness when expressing her gratitude and happiness.</p>
		<p>Although her somewhat clumsy English tends to project the image of an innocent, clueless child, those who understand her talking in Indonesian tend to understand her bratty mannerisms and language more. However, as she got more used to talking with her fellow members, the gap between the two has diminished</p>
