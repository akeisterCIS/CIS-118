<h2>So, Why is my Opinion Important?</h2>
<h3>To be perfectly honest, it really isn't in the grand scheme of things.</h3>
<p>I've only just recently this year been introduced to Hololive and all of it's talents. A friend of mine introduced me to Hololive via short clips of their livestreams, and I found them funny. Additionally, a developer by the name of Kay Yu made the fangame "Holocure" which is a survival hack and slash game made with the characters and their movesets are largely based off of things related to the characters themselves. I spent many hours on this game and absolutely fell in love with it.</p>
<p>Thus, this kickstarted my likeness for Hololive.</p>
<p>I unfortunately do not have any photos with merchandise from the franchise, hwoever in the meantime I hope you enjoy this photo of me and my dog, Medic.</p>
<p>In the future, I intend to collect more Hololive merchandise, more specifically the figures made of these characters. Hopefully I can grow my collection to contain more than just figures, though.</p>
<p>To conclude this short blurb, I thoroughly enjoyed this project and I had a great time learning about the Hololive talents and the company itself. I hope to learn even more about them going forward exploring the franchise.</p>
