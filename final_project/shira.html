		<h3>Shirakami Fubuki</h3>
		<h3>白上フブキ</h3>

		<p>"White-haired animal-eared otaku fox. She loves talking with people and will be happy if you give her the time of day.　
She aims to become a top otaku idol while enjoying each and every day."</p>
		<h3>Background Information</h3>
		<p>Shirakami Fubuki (白上フブキ) is a female Japanese Virtual Youtuber associated with hololive, debuting as part of its first generation of VTubers alongside Yozora Mel, Aki Rosenthal, Natsuiro Matsuri and Akai Haato. She is also part of a unit inside hololive called hololive Gamers</p>
		<p>Fubuki often becomes enthralled with the games she plays. During her time while playing games, she will often have conversations with scripted game characters or will even voice the characters while making various sound effects.</p>
		<p>She greets her viewers with "Kon Kon Kitsune!," which official subs seem to interpret as "Foxy day to you!"</p>
		<p>Fubuki is one to fearlessly march to the beat of her own drum, sometimes to a career risking degree. For example, she has once said that if hololive forced her to say something she didn't want to on stream, she would rather quit her job.</p>
