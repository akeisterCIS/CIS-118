		<h3>Gawr Gura</h3>
		<h3>がうる・ぐら</h3>

		<p>"A descendant of the Lost City of Atlantis, who swam to Earth while saying, "It's so boring down there LOLOLOL!"
Gura bought her clothes (and her shark hat) in the human world and she really loves them. In her spare time, she enjoys talking to marine life."</p>
		<h3>Background Information</h3>
		<p>Gawr Gura (がうる・ぐら) is a female English-speaking Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, debuting in 2020 as part of hololive English first generation "-Myth-" alongside Ninomae Ina'nis, Takanashi Kiara, Watson Amelia and Mori Calliope.</p>
		<p>Gura is currently the most subscribed VTuber worldwide, taking the #1 spot from industry pioneer Kizuna AI in 2021. As of November 2022, Gura has over 4 million YouTube subscribers.</p>
		<p>Gura is friendly and readily likeable, and often amuses her viewers with foolish antics. She has no sense of direction, often misspells and mispronounces words, has trouble remembering her own age, and consistently fails to solve basic math problems, leading viewers to affectionately call her a "dum shark". Memorably, one viewer declared that "Gura has a heart of gold and a head of bone."</p>
		<p>However, despite her poor math and spelling skills, Gura is quick-witted, clever, and has vast knowledge of Shark Facts. When questioned on why she was not "boing boing," she excused it by claiming that she was "hydrodynamic." Her skill with fast-paced rhythm games is exceptional, and she is highly ambitious. She also occasionally makes lewd jokes, and is familiar with modern meme culture, which she references often.</p>
